# Web-Design-Challenge
<h3>About this Project</h3>
<ul>
<li>This was a fairly straightforward project. Much of the code was repetitive after the index page and I was just cloning and modifying as needed.</li>
<li>I initially used my own results from the <a href="https://github.com/maali007/python-api-challenge" target="_blank">python-api-challenge</a> but noticed my humidity and wind speed scatter plots were identical. I then replaced the 4 plots with those in the assignment resources folder.</li>
<li>For the table, I used a CSV to HTML converter courtesy of <a href="https://codebeautify.org/csv-to-html">codebeautify.org</a></li>
<li>I deployed my project to <a href="https://maali007.github.io/index.html" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> as required.</li>
